Code description: 
NAM.rar:  The neirborhood aware multi-label crowdsourcing classifcation algorithm. To get demo results,  run NAM/main.m in matlab.


NAC.rar:  The active multi-label crowdosurcing learning algorithm extended from NAM. To get demo results,  run NAC/main.m in matlab.


RAM.rar: The label relevance ware multi-label crowdsourcing classifcation algorithm.  To get demo results,  run RAM/main.m in matlab.

RAC.rar:The active multi-label crowdosurcing learning algorithm extended from RAM. To get demo results,  run NAC/main.m in matlab.

data_sample.rar:  one dataset sample used in [1], corresponds to the dataset1 in [1].
